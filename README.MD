# Client Defolt Model


End-to-end ML pipeline for predicting credit card default probability.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete MLops pipeline for predicting the probability of credit card default using the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features

- **Data Validation**: Great Expectations for data quality checks
- **Feature Engineering**: Automated feature creation and transformation
- **ML Pipeline**: Sklearn pipelines with preprocessing and modeling
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for experiment management
- **Version Control**: DVC for data and model versioning
- **REST API**: FastAPI for model serving
- **Monitoring**: Data drift detection
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment
